
In sooth I know not why I am so sad
It wearies me you say it wearies you
But how I caught it found it or came by it
What stuff tis made of whereof it is born
I am to learn
And such a want wit sadness makes of me
That I have much ado to know myself

Your mind is tossing on the ocean
There where your argosies with portly sail
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
Or as it were the pageants of the sea
Do overpeer the petty traffickers
That curtsy to them do them reverence
As they fly by them with their woven wings

Believe me sir had I such venture forth
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad I should be still
Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
Would make me sad

My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague when I thought
What harm a wind too great at sea might do
I should not see the sandy hour glass run
But I should think of shallows and of flats
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand
Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side
Would scatter all her spices on the stream
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks
And in a word but even now worth this
And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought
To think on this and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad
But tell not me I know 
Is sad to think upon his merchandise

Believe me no I thank my fortune for it
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted
Nor to one place nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad

Why then you are in love

Fie fie

Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad
Because you are not merry and twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry
Because you are not sad Now by two headed Janus
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag piper
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable
Enter   and 


Here comes  your most noble kinsman
 and  Fare ye well
We leave you now with better company

I would have stay'd till I had made you merry
If worthier friends had not prevented me

Your worth is very dear in my regard
I take it your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart

Good morrow my good lords

Good signiors both when shall we laugh say when
You grow exceeding strange must it be so

We'll make our leisures to attend on yours
Exeunt  and 


My Lord  since you have found 
We two will leave you but at dinner time
I pray you have in mind where we must meet

I will not fail you

You look not well Signior 
You have too much respect upon the world
They lose it that do buy it with much care
Believe me you are marvellously changed

I hold the world but as the world 
A stage where every man must play a part
And mine a sad one

Let me play the fool
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans
Why should a man whose blood is warm within
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish I tell thee what 
I love thee and it is my love that speaks
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond
And do a wilful stillness entertain
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom gravity profound conceit
As who should say I am Sir Oracle
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark'
O my  I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing when I am very sure
If they should speak would almost damn those ears
Which hearing them would call their brothers fools
I'll tell thee more of this another time
But fish not with this melancholy bait
For this fool gudgeon this opinion
Come good  Fare ye well awhile
I'll end my exhortation after dinner

Well we will leave you then till dinner time
I must be one of these same dumb wise men
For  never lets me speak

Well keep me company but two years moe
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue

Farewell I'll grow a talker for this gear

Thanks i' faith for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible
Exeunt  and 


Is that any thing now

 speaks an infinite deal of nothing more
than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you
shall seek all day ere you find them and when you
have them they are not worth the search

Well tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage
That you to day promised to tell me of

'Tis not unknown to you 
How much I have disabled mine estate
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged To you 
I owe the most in money and in love
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe

I pray you good  let me know it
And if it stand as you yourself still do
Within the eye of honour be assured
My purse my person my extremest means
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions

In my school days when I had lost one shaft
I shot his fellow of the self same flight
The self same way with more advised watch
To find the other forth and by adventuring both
I oft found both I urge this childhood proof
Because what follows is pure innocence
I owe you much and like a wilful youth
That which I owe is lost but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt
As I will watch the aim or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first

You know me well and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done
And I am prest unto it therefore speak

In Belmont is a lady richly left
And she is fair and fairer than that word
Of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages
Her name is  nothing undervalued
To Cato's daughter Brutus' 
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand
And many Jasons come in quest of her
O my  had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them
I have a mind presages me such thrift
That I should questionless be fortunate

Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum therefore go forth
Try what my credit can in Venice do
That shall be rack'd even to the uttermost
To furnish thee to Belmont to fair 
Go presently inquire and so will I
Where money is and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake
Exeunt

SCENE II Belmont A room in S house
Enter  and 


By my troth  my little body is aweary of
this great world

You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are and
yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing It
is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the
mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but
competency lives longer

Good sentences and well pronounced

They would be better if well followed

If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do chapels had been churches and poor men's
cottages princes' palaces It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may
devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the
youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband O me the word choose' I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father Is it not hard
 that I cannot choose one nor refuse none

Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their
death have good inspirations therefore the lottery
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold
silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come

I pray thee over name them and as thou namest
them I will describe them and according to my
description level at my affection

First there is the Neapolitan prince

Ay that's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts that he can
shoe him himself I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith

Then there is the County Palatine

He doth nothing but frown as who should say If you
will not have me choose' he hears merry tales and
smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be
married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these God defend me from these
two

How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon

God made him and therefore let him pass for a man
In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but
he why he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitan's a better bad habit of frowning than
the Count Palatine he is every man in no man if a
throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will
fence with his own shadow if I should marry him I
should marry twenty husbands If he would despise me
I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I
shall never requite him

What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron
of England

You know I say nothing to him for he understands
not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French
nor Italian and you will come into the court and
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English
He is a proper man's picture but alas who can
converse with a dumb show How oddly he is suited
I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round
hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his
behavior every where

What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour

That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another

How like you the young German the Duke of Saxony's nephew

Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and
most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when
he is best he is a little worse than a man and
when he is worst he is little better than a beast
and the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall
make shift to go without him

If he should offer to choose and choose the right
casket you should refuse to perform your father's
will if you should refuse to accept him

Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without I know he will choose it I will do any
thing  ere I'll be married to a sponge

You need not fear lady the having any of these
lords they have acquainted me with their
determinations which is indeed to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father's
imposition depending on the caskets

If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as
chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner
of my father's will I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable for there is not one among them
but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant
them a fair departure

Do you not remember lady in your father's time a
Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat

Yes yes it was  as I think he was so called

True madam he of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon was the best deserving a fair lady

I remember him well and I remember him worthy of
thy praise
Enter a Serving man

How now what news
Servant
The four strangers seek for you madam to take
their leave and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth the Prince of  who brings word the
prince his master will be here to night

If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should
be glad of his approach if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had
rather he should shrive me than wive me Come
 Sirrah go before
Whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer another knocks at the door
